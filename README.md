# Store Simulator

(For Class) Project to simulate a digital store.

Stock and user information can be directly edited through the input file. A real implementation would use a database.

Uses Qt for GUI.

Honestly the only cool feature here is the product recommendation system based on previous reviews / purchases and other users who bought the same things / rated those things. Computes a similarity measure between you and other users and uses that to recommend other products you might like.
